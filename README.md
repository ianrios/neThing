An Educational Open-Source Web-based Graphical User Interface for Controlling Ambisonic and Wave Field Speaker Arrays

## Abstract

As multi-channel speaker arrays become more common within academic and research-oriented institutions, opportunities to expose casual listeners to the complex of erings of ambisonic and wave field systems have become more prevalent. The neThing project introduces a graphical, easy-to-use, free, open source, and educational web interface to control ambisonic and wave field arrays. By creating a simple user experience for both server and user side control, we attempt to remove technical and conceptual barriers that potentially hinder access to such systems, while at the same time increasing interest to use and maintain these large-scale systems. By reducing the barriers to entry on use and experimentation with multi-channel speaker arrays, students can more easily experiment with this format of audio presentation. Finally, by using a web application, we simplify the software profile needed to be distributed across end users, allowing for mobile use as well.
